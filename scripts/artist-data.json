      "description": "\"When I wrote ETHER with RAC and my long time collaborator Peter Wade, I was feeling overwhelmed by the deep dark days of social media’s Cult Of Self-Obsession and the destructive force it has on the world.  I felt like I couldn’t breathe because there was a larger than life, algorithm-driven monster determined to exploit the worst in all of us.  It was crippling.  However, in writing this song, I began to shift and shed this destruction and focus on the simplicity of connecting…a real connection.  I started to shift my CULT OF ME into the COMMUNITY OF US and realized that even on the smallest levels, connection is key to LOVE EVOL.  Clearly RAC was connected to that ethos as his production brought these lyrics to life in another dimension that I never could have expected.\n\nETHER is the clear sky above the clouds where I want to live and evolve.  Release me, come alive ... we're coming to love…Ether.  It transcends it all.\" - MNDR\n\nArtwork by Andres Reisinger"

      "description": "I grew up playing video games. Some of my earliest memories include blowing into NES cartridges and playing zelda on the OG gameboy.\nThat type of music has influenced me so much and I find myself holding back from letting it come through in a lot of my original work. It still seems to creep in from time to time though. \nThis time around, no holding back. \n\nInspired by a lot of childhood memories glued to a screen. It's quite upbeat at 150bpm, a lot of sounds are from the FM synth era of genesis/snes without sounding too \"videogamey\". Melodically it's pretty happy sounding but I think there's a hint of melancholy. I like playing in that middle ground. Instead of doing straight up vocal chops, I decided to sample various vocals and use them as instruments. In fact, most of the sounds are derived from the human voice. I haven't made a song at 150bpm in a while and I forgot how fun it can be.\n\nHope you like it.\n\nThis is my 2nd web3 exclusive track. Only available here on Audius and Catalog"
